# Matching Game: Emotions

A memory game that focuses on matching the same emotions. The goal of the game is to match all 8 pairs of emotions in the least amount of moves (8 moves) with the highest star rating (3 stars) in the shortest amount of time. The 8 pairs of emotions are based on the universal emotions: anger, happiness, sadness, surprise, disgust, fear, contentment and -- one fun throw in -- confusion. Do you remember how the last card you flipped felt? Are you on the same page?
